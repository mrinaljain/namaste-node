## Questions

- What is the diffrence between Objects and Maps?
Use Object when you need to store key-value pairs where keys are strings or symbols, and you don't need the extra features that Map offers.
Use Map when you need more flexibility with key types, guaranteed insertion order, or frequent key-value manipulations.
